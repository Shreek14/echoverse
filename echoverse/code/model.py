Input: Once the Wind and the Sun had an argument. “I am stronger than you,” said the Wind. “No,
you are not,” said the Sun. Just at that moment they saw a traveler walking across the road.
He was wrapped in a shawl. The Sun and the Wind agreed that whoever could separate the
traveller from his shawl was stronger.
The Wind took the first turn. He blew with all his might to tear the traveller’s shawl from his
shoulders. But the harder he blew, the tighter the traveller gripped the shawl to his body.
The struggle went on till the Wind’s turn was over.
Now it was the Sun’s turn. The Sun smiled warmly. The traveller felt the warmth of the
smiling Sun. Soon he let the shawl fall open. The Sun’s smile grew warmer and warmer...
hotter and hotter. Now the traveller no longer needed his shawl. He took it off and dropped
it on the ground. The Sun was declared stronger than the Wind.
